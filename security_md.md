2. **Private Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### What to Include

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Precision Loss**: Very small dividend amounts may have minor rounding errors due to integer division
2. **Gas Costs**: Users pay gas fees to claim dividends
3. **Owner Dependency**: Dividends require manual owner deposits
4. **No Emergency Stop**: Contract cannot be paused once deployed

### Mitigation Strategies

- Users should claim dividends in batches to minimize gas costs
- Owner should establish regular dividend deposit schedule
- Consider multi-signature wallet for owner account
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment

---

## 🔍 Audit Status

### Current Status
- ⏳ **Pre-Audit**: Code review and testing phase
- 📋 **Planned**: Professional security audit before mainnet launch

### Audit Recommendations

Before mainnet deployment, we recommend:
1. Professional security audit by reputable firm
2. Economic audit for tokenomics
3. Formal verification for critical functions
4. Public bug bounty program

## 🚨 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Token Holders

✅ **DO**:
- Verify contract address before interacting
- Use hardware wallet for large holdings
- Check transaction details before signing
- Keep private keys secure
- Monitor your balance regularly

❌ **DON'T**:
- Share private keys or seed phrases
- Approve unlimited token allowances
- Trust unverified contract addresses
- Interact with contract on unsecure networks
- Store large amounts without proper backup

### For Contract Owner

✅ **DO**:
- Use hardware wallet or multi-sig
- Test all operations on testnet first
- Document all privileged actions
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Have emergency response plan

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use hot wallets for owner account
- Make unannounced critical changes
- Ignore community feedback
- Skip testing procedures
- Centralize control without governance
